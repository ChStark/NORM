# NORM
 
 NORM stands for No ORM framework. NORM is not a PosgreSQL extention, not a library, and not a set of functions.
 
 NORM is an approach (a thechnology) which allows object-oriented applications to interact with relational databases
 directly, without involving any ORM. Why we want to avoid ORM? because it decreases application's performance.
 
 The doc directory of the repo contains the ppt of the presentations from SOFSEM 2020 conference. 
 Please take a look to find out why NORM was developed, and what are it's advantaes.
 
 The sql directory contains a working example of how to build PostgreSQL types and functions using NORM technology.
